Sets "Uploaded to this post" instead of "All media items" as the default view in the media uploader.

== Description ==
WordPress 3.5 introduced an entirely new media uploader which streamlined the way one handles and uploads images to posts. Unfortunately, 
since then, the default view for the media library is "All media items" instead of "Uploaded to this post". This plugin sets "Uploaded to this post" 
as the default view.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the extracted plugin folder and contained files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
